This is a text-messaging service created with django and twilio to send scheduled text message queries about health goals, collect health data, and generate graphical summaries of the collected data. Users will have the option to send these summaries and data to their doctors.

Users can [sign up for the service here](https://emmaremy.github.io/lhd-2016.html).
